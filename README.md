## Description

For this assignment I was tasked with creating an application where an employer could use to easily see their employees and roles that work there in a clean table format. The user will be able to navigate the options so they can view all roles, departments and employees. The user will also be able to add a department, role or employee to their database. When the prompts are finished being entered the user will be brought back to the options to select from so they can view their changes. This will make it easier for the company to organize and look through the data of their company.

## Usage

The user will be able to go through prompts to be able to view data pertaining to their company. The user can see all of their employees, their roles as well as the departments they have in their business. This will allow the user to organize and see what data their is that pertains to their employees. With all the employee information and departments laid out for the employer then this will make it easier to organize and expand their business.

## Installation

You will need to install node, inquirer, console.table and MySQL2 after cloning the repo
